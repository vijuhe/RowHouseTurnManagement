# Row House Turn Management
Cross-platform mobile application for managing turns in a row house. 
You can use it for example for managing whose turn it is to cut the grass of common areas.
The purpose of the application is to replace papers that are being circulated from one door or mailbox to another
to signal that a task has been done and now it's the neighbours turn to do the same task next time.
